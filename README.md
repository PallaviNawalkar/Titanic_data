- This is the original data from Titanic competition plus some changes that I applied to it to be better suited for binary logistic regression:

- Merged the train and test data.

- Removed the 'ticket' and 'cabin' attributes.

- Moved the 'Survived' attribute to the last column.

- Added extra zero columns for categorical inputs to be better suited for One-Hot-Encoding.

- Substituted the values of 'Sex' and 'Embarked' attributes with binary and categorical values respectively.

- Filled the missing values in 'Age' and 'Fare' attributes with the median of the data.
